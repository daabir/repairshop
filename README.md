## What is this project?

A Ticket management application built in Next.js (typescript). The application lets you create and manage tickets, customers, employees etc.

## Requirements

Set up the .env file using your respective keys for Kinde-auth and Neon Postgres DB.

## How to Run:

```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
```
The above command can be customized in the package.json file.

## Notes:

This app can actually be turned into many different apps like an advanced to-do list app (with or without backend support), a small business management app, a business portfolio along with tons of admin controls and much more.
\nIf God allows, I will create some of these based on this app.
